# Binary Pizza Classification

## Binary Tensorflow Model Using Convolutional Neural Network

<img src="./previews/preview_1.png" width="800"/>

- It was trained using the following Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosrunner/pizza-not-pizza)
- The model has between 70% - 80% accuracy

### This Model was builded using the following technologies:
> - ðŸ“Œ `Tensorflow` and `Keras API`
> - ðŸ“Œ Convolutional Neural Network

The model was exported using `TensorflowJS` so it can be proved using HTML-CSS-JS 

## Test the Model using your Webcam:
